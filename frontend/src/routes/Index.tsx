        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
          This full stack application is a web-based solution designed to help
          users manage their tasks and compare them to others across the world!
        </p>
        <p>
          The frontend of the application is built using popular web
          technologies, namely HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React to
          create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          The backend of the application is powered by Node, Express,
          TypeScript, and Prisma, providing a robust and scalable server-side
          solution for handling API requests, processing data, and interacting
          with the database.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application data is stored in a SQL database, specifically MySQL,
          which provides high reliability, security, and scalability. Using the
          Prisma ORM (Object Relational Mapping) the backend and database are
          able to communicate effectively to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
          Delete) operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          User authentication and authorization is handled using JWTs (JSON Web
          Token) to ensure that the data is secure and only accessible to
          authorized users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this full stack application is designed to be user friendly,
          fast, and efficient, providing users with an intuitive and responsive
          interface that allows them to create and manage their tasks and
          compare then to others with ease. The application is easily scalable,
          and its modular architecture allows for easy maintenance and updates
          in the future.

        <h1>Architecture</h1>
        <p>
          Frontend: The frontend layer is responsible for presenting the user
          interface and handling user interactions. It communicates with the
          backend via REST APIs sending requests to retrieve or modify data.
          Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
        </p>
        <p>
          Backend: The backend layer is responsible for processing requests from
          the frontend and interacting with the database to retrieve or store
          data. It implements RESTful APIs, handles business logic manages
          security, authentication, and authorization. Built using Node,
          Express, TypeScript, and Prisma.
        </p>
        <p>
          Database: The database layer is responsible for storing and managing
          the data required by the application. It stores the data in a
          structured format and provides a way for the backend to retrieve,
          modify, and delete data. Built using MySQL and communicates to the
          backend via the Prisma ORM.

        <h1>Comments</h1>
        <h2>Frontend</h2>
        <p>
          Tooling: Although there are many options Vite is used for the frontend
          tooling.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS: The design of the frontend is meant to be dark and minimal. After
          building so many light theme projects I wanted to change it up and use
          a dark theme. I also wanted to use sidebar navigation, meaning it had
          to be compatible with mobile devices. This is solved with a media
          query to place the navigation above the page at a small enough screen
          size.
        </p>
        <p>
          Routes: Routing is handled using the React Router package. This
          package is by far the most popular method to handle routing in a React
          project. There are three routing parents on the frontend. First,
          everything is wrapped in the Root that handles the layout of the UI.
          Secondly, there is a private set of routes that requires a sign in to
          use. Lastly, there is a public set of routes that requires a sign out
          to use. The private set includes pages such as "My Tasks" and so on,
          while the public set includes routes such as "Sign In" and "Sign Up".
          This logic is enforced using navigation, so if you attempt to visit a
          private route while signed out you will be pushed to a public route.
        </p>
        <p>
          Context: Although many prefer to use a global state manager like
          Redux, React has a built in option now called Context. This feature is
          utilized to store the user of the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Components: While each page is a component, a few other custom
          components are used. A notable one is the "Task" component. This
          component is passed props from the parent and is built using such
          values. This powerful tool allows a flexible way to build UI across
          the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hooks: Many built in hooks are used throughout the application, such
          as useState and useEffect, but a few custom hooks are used. Such as
          the useUser hook that is used throughout the application to verify the
          existence of a user. This hook fetches from the backend and modifies
          the Context of the application accordingly.
        </p>
        <h2>Backend</h2>
        <p>
          MVC (Model View Controller): The backend of the application follows
          the MVC design methodology to create strong organization, flexibility,
          reusability, testability, and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Middleware: Middleware is also used throughout the backend to improve
          code organization, reusability, flexibility, performance, and
          security. A typical one used is an authorization check on protected
          routes. Routes that involve sensitive operations, like create, update,
          and delete, are protected by an authorization middleware to ensure
          that the user attempting to access such routes is allowed access. This
          specific middleware checks the credentials (JWT) of the user to
          prevent impersonation. Another common middleware used is an error
          handler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Error Handling: As described above an error handling middleware is
          used to catch unexpected exceptions. Otherwise, try and catch
          statements are used to handle expected errors and return an
          appropriate response. A good example is the verification process of
          the JWT. The verification process throws an error when an invalid
          token is provided. So, this method is wrapped in another try catch so
          when it does through a 401 code with error message json is returned.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTTP Methods: To create a RESTful backend proper HTTP methods are
          used. That is for create, read, update, and delete, "POST", "GET",
          "PUT", and "DELETE" are used respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responses: To create RESTful backend proper responses also need to be
          returned. That means using proper codes, and a common data format.
          This is done using responses such as 401 for unauthorized, 404 for not
          found, 201 for creates, and so forth. This also means using JSON as
          the response data format in the event data is sent. This is done and
          common values are used. For example all error messages use the
          variable "errorMessage".
        </p>
        <p>
          Data: As this is a RESTful API the service is stateless, so the
          application data is stored in a database. The database communication
          is done via the ORM Prisma. Many are split on the use of an ORM but
          for the purposes of this application it is fitting.
        </p>
        <h2>Database</h2>
        <p>
          SQL: SQL was used for this application for its reliability, security,
          and scalability.
        </p>
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>
          Git: Like all projects Git is used for version control. Git Ignore is
          also used to protect sensitive data.
        </p>
        <p>
          GitHub: The repository for this project is stored on GitHub like all
          my projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Docker: All my projects utilize docker consistency, portability,
          efficiency, scalability, version control, and isolation. For this
          project only the builds are made using docker but the development
          environments can also be built using docker.
        </p>
        <p>
          Railway: This application is hosted on Railway for its ease of use,
          low cost, and GitOps.
